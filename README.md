# Treehouse Python Techdegree Unit 5




Create an interface for a portfolio web application. The main (index) page lists your projects including the project title and short description. Each project links to a detail page that displays the title, date, and description.

The application lets the user add or edit project information. When adding or editing a project, the application prompts the user for title, date, skills, description, and a link to a repo. The results for these entries are stored in a database and displayed on the homepage. The HTML/CSS for this site has been supplied for you.

## What I learned

During my techdegree I  completed several projects which allowed me to explore different elements of python development. Those projects with their learnings are listed below  

1. The Number Guessing Game

Built a console number guessing game that prompts a player to choose a number between a specified range of numbers in which I applied my learning of error handling, user input handling 

2. Basketball Stats Tool

Build a console-based basketball team statistics tool in which  I applied my knowledge of important Python data structures like lists and dictionaries for the project, fillie handling with CSV , data cleaning


3. Phrase Hunters

Used Python and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) approaches to select a phrase at random, hidden from the player.

4. Store Inventory with SQLAlchemy

Build a console application that loads an existing store's inventory data from a CSV file into a SQLite database. I applied my learning of SQL Alchemy and python csv module to 
stored items in the  the database,view existing records, add new items, and backup/export the existing state of the database into a CSV file.


5. Portfolio with SQLAlchemy 

Create a web application using HTML, CSS, and Flask, a popular framework for Python web development. I learned how to use flask for web development, jinja templating, Flask-SQLAlchemy to display database information on the site from a Flask-SQLAlchemy Model.
