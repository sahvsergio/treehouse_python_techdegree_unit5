  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    A passionate Python developer with a focus on web development. Over the past
    three months, I've honed my skills and recently earned my Python Development
    Techdegree. I'm particularly interested in building web applications that
    can make a global impact, which has driven me to learn frameworks like Flask
    and Django. Additionally, I'm exploring the field of Robotic Process
    Automation. During my Techdegree program, I developed five unique portfolio
    projects, with my favorite being the creation of this very portfolio
    website. I utilized Flask, Jinja2, and Flask-SQLAlchemy to bring my ideas to
    life and showcase my journey as a developer. Beyond coding, I enjoy
    independent learning, tutoring friends and family, and watching
    documentaries. I'm committed to continuous growth and am excited about the
    opportunities that lie ahead in the tech world.
